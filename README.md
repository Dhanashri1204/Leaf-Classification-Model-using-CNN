# Leaf-Classification-Model-using-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify Chinar, Mango, and Pomegranate leaves based on their images.

## Why this Project is Useful
Identifying different types of leaves is crucial in agricultural studies, biodiversity conservation, and plant species monitoring. This project provides an automated solution to classify leaf types with high accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- TensorFlow
- Required Python libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leaf-classification-cnn.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd leaf-classification-cnn
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Place your images in the `classification` folder.
2. Run the model for classification:
   ```bash
   python classify.py
   ```
3. The results, including class probabilities and confidence levels, will be displayed in the terminal.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amandam1/healthy-vs-diseased-leaf-image-dataset). However, only specific images were used for training and testing. To replicate the results:

1. Download the original dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amandam1/healthy-vs-diseased-leaf-image-dataset).
2. Extract the dataset.
3. Copy the following specific images to the `leafs` directory:
   - `path/to/image1.jpg`
   - `path/to/image2.jpg`
   - `...`
